# COGS118B_Project

We used the MNIST dataset, which consists of images of handwritten digits. We wanted to see how 
much information we could gain about the dataset using the methods learned in class. We fit a 
single Multivariate Bernoulli Distribution, Kmeans, and Mixture of Multivariate Bernoulli Models
to the dataset.
